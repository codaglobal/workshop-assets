# Contributing to Coda Launchpad assets

As you all are aware of this initiative to spread knowledge to students as much as possible. We need more contribution on getting sample applications ready for the students as reference. 

1. All the examples should contain code that can be easily understood by novice.

```
.
├── Angular+Express_JS+Mongo
│   └── event-management-system
├── Angular+SpringBoot+MySQL
│   └── event-management-system
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

2. Each stack can have multiple usecase implementations. For now, event-management-system is the only usecase considered.

3. Each project should contain a readme file containing documentation for the project.
